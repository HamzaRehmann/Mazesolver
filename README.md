# MazeSolver

**Technologies Used:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Prolog

## Overview
MazeSolver is an AI-based project focused on generating randomized mazes and solving them using various search algorithms. The project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of multiple pathfinding algorithms including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Greedy Best-First Search, and A* Search.

## Features
- **Maze Generation:** Utilizes a randomized depth-first search algorithm to generate dynamic mazes.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** Implements BFS, DFS, Greedy Best-First Search, and A* Search to solve the mazes.
- **Visualization:** Uses Matplotlib to visualize the paths found by each algorithm.
- **Performance Analysis:** Compares the execution times of different algorithms and visualizes the results with bar charts.
- **Prolog Integration:** Includes logic reasoning with Prolog to define and query node adjacency relationships (currently in prototype phase).

## Usage
1. Run the main script to generate and solve a maze:
    ```bash
    mazesolver.py
    ```
2. Adjust the maze dimensions and algorithm selection through the user interface or by modifying the script parameters.
